      <description>The version 1.2.0 of Crackhead Adventures has arrived! It will probably be the last version, unless a major bug is found or the game finds a small following, since we want to move on to other projects. This is just the beginning of our gamedev journey, and a successful one at that! We&amp;rsquo;d like to thank to everyone who played the game and supported us through the development. We love you &amp;lt;3</description>
